Tried replicating the structure of the assignment. However after a few trials and complete redos I have come to realisation that I am long way off from grasping the concepts covered in the CSS unit. 

Also a reminder that this course is not like most courses. Its fastpaced and without a good amount of efforts from my side, it will be hard to keep up. 

I tried quite a few things on the banners. Used the Flex box options, tried floats, tried to create a grid layout. But none of them seem to work. 

The other thing that I couldn't get working properly was the About me page. I tried float and clear. But that did not work out. so in the end I used the grid layout again - divided the screen into 1 row and two columns. The first column housed the heading and the image. The second column housed the text. But again I could not get the text to vertical - align to the centre of the column.
